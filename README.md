# Send HTML Form to Telegram
Using Telegram BOT API, HTML forms, jQuery and JavaScript

File jq.html is the first version that uses form input field that are hidden for token and chan_id variables

File jqo.html uses the function for static variables

Both use bootstrap for the nice looking form and jquery for the scripts

Haven't had the change to make it work over IPFS yet, it doesn't reply with telegram message. While being hosted on a normal webserver it posts telegram message as expected.

I need to better implement all elements into one file, while being obfuscated using [obfuscator.io](https://obfuscator.io)

You can find me on Telegram using @SomniusX or the link [t.me/SomniusX](http://t.me/SomniusX)
